// Simple calculator example

// Numbers to operate on
let x: int = 10;
let y: int = 5;

// Addition
let sum = x + y;
print sum;

// Subtraction
let diff = x - y;
print diff;

// Multiplication
let product = x * y;
print product;

// Division
let quotient = x / y;
print quotient;

// More complex expression
let result = (x + y) * (x - y);
print result;
